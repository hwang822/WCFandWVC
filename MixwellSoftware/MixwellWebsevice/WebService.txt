A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized XML messaging system. XML is used to encode all communications to a web service. For example, a client invokes a web service by sending an XML message, then waits for a corresponding XML response.

Web services are of two kinds: Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (REST). 

SOAP defines a standard communication protocol (set of rules) specification for XML-based message exchange. SOAP uses different transport protocols, such as HTTP and SMTP.

While REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style for networked hypermedia applications, it is primarily used to build Web services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. A service based on REST is called a RESTful service.

JSON, XML, Remote Procedure Calls, SOAP and REST


Webservice is programing in any platforms to talk any language over networking.

JSON - a java script object notation. But it could work at any language but not js.
 
Standard: {Key : value,  Key : value, {key, : value} ...}  pair

.Object: Unordered collection of key/value paris
.Null: Empty value

.Uses Key/values pairs - {"name" : "Brad"}
.Uses double quotes around Key and Value
.Must use the specified data types.
.File type is ".json"

HTML file to present web UI.
   html has head and body, the body has script to run java script functions.

to install live-server to run html as server in local

C:\Users\Hongbo>npm install -g live-server

then CD to the folder of the server.

C:\Users\Hongbo>cd C:\Workarea\WCFandWVC\MixwellSoftware\MixwellWebsevice\Json Sandbox

C:\Workarea\WCFandWVC\MixwellSoftware\MixwellWebsevice\Json Sandbox>

create index.html file in this folder
